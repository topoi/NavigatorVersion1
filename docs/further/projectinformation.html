                    The archaeological remains of the royal residential city of Memphis, about 18 km south of modern city of Cairo, gained a particular prominence within Egyptology, especially due to the royal pyramid-complexes of the Old and Middle Kingdom. The Memphite region comprises more than 40 skm, stretches from Abusir in the North to Dahshur in the south and includes the temple of the main local god Ptah in Mit Rahina as well as the necropolis associated to the people working in the city of Memphis.The archaeological legacy of the New Kingdom (c. 1550 - 1070 BC) remained uninvestigated until 1975 when the Egypt Exploration Society in cooperation with the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden initiated the systematic documentation of elite tombs from this period. The fieldwork in this area has continued at the site uninterrupted since then and as of 2016 it is a cooperation between the Museo Egizio Turin, the university of Leiden and the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden. In addition, several other fieldwork missions were able to unearth more than 13 New Kingdom burial sites and about 100 tomb complexes dating to the same period have been identified. Those tombs and its equipment (e.g. coffins, stelae, statues, canopic jars, shabtis and decorated limestone blocks) eventually revealed a multiplicity of prosopographic data. Relevant texts and inscriptions are to be found on the walls of the tombs as well as on different types of objects, which originally were part of the tomb's equipment or decoration. Their purpose and function are to document a person's collective information and to spread and to maintain it within a bigger social context. Although numerous inscribed objects of Memphite origin were transferred to museum collections all over the world since the middle of 19th century and in addition current excavations add substantial quantities of new epigraphic material regularly, scientific investigations of persons, who are recorded in those inscriptions they left intentionally on objects and monuments have not been achieved in big scale. Moreover, the relevant works done so far, like the prosopographic studies of Wolfgang Helck, Beatrix Gessler-Löhr, Stephane Pasquali and Nico Staring were in most cases concentrated on a specific group of persons and therefore provided only a selective representation of the Memphite society. In addition the relatively small amount of data used so far could not serve as a basis for conclusive statistical analyses or further digital processing. That is why it is the aim of the Prosopographia Memphitica (ProM) Project to attain a Memphite prosopography for the New Kingdom, which is for the first time not limited to specific groups of people but illuminates all identifiable social classes of the Memphite society. By evaluating and comparing all prosopographic data of a person's social environment, it is the aim to shed light not only on the identity of the individual, but especially on the reconstruction of social interrelations within a whole network of persons. The methodological framework for the interpretation of recorded prosopographic data is formed by Social Network Analysis (SNA). By using this type of analysis, a person is no longer defined as an isolated unit but as an individual who is acting with other people on a social level. As such, individuals can be assigned to certain groups of persons by using specific parameters. These can be defined by social and genealogical affiliations, gender, institutional or professional background and geographic origin. Within a network of person with same parameter (like institutional affiliation) every social actor is represented as a node, who can be connected to each other by so called edges. An individual might be connected to any other member of the network in a direct way, for example in case of genealogical affiliations, but can also be indirectly related to each other. Like Stanley Milgram already stated in his 1967 published paper: The Small World Problem, in: Psychology, 60-67, Individuals who don't show any detectable direct conection, can be linked to each other by other persons. The most striking advantage of SNA is therefore recognizable at a first glance: the Memphite society is not anymore understood as a mere sequence of individuals and their direct relatives, but it connects people from different social classes, institutional affiliations and genealogical origins.                </div>

                    This searchable web-based database is the result of my doctoral research at the Freie Universität Berlin called 'Prosopographia Memphitica. Individuelle Identitäten und Kollektive Biographien einer Residenzstadt des Neuen Reiches', supervised by Univ.-Prof. Dr. Jochem Kahl and PD Dr. Dietrich Raue (University of Leipzig). The project was part of the TOPOI Research Group C1 - Deixis and Frames of Reference: Strategies of Perspectivation in Language, Text, and Image (Oct 2015-Oct 2018).<p><p>An unpublished collection (card box) which has been compiled by Dietrich Raue since the 1990s and comprises 1121 individuals formed the basis of the database. Over the course of this project, the number of persons recorded in the corpus was doubled, so that the ProM collection currently comprises 2343 persons, i.e. 1528 men and 814 women as well as 992 Egyptian titles from different administrative sectors.<p><p>Furthermore, the database records 1676 objects associated to the Memphite region, of which 56 % are nowadays spread over museums all over the world, whereas the other 44% remain in situ, were transferred to the excavation storerooms on site or are in an unknown location. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo owns 278 objects and thus forms the largest outpost of prosopographic material. Since the 1820s a large number of architectural elements and funerary equipment from Memphite tombs has made its way into the museums in Europe (as well as North-America and even Australia) through the activities of early excavators, and antiquities dealers. As a result, the collections of Leiden, London, Paris, Florence, Vienna, Berlin, Bologna, Turin and Hanover have become important European outposts of the Memphite region. In total, 118 different museums and collections in 28 countries have been identified that host relevant material for the present study. Although not all objects could have been examined during the course of the project, the accessible and published information concerning them, have been incorporated.                </div>
