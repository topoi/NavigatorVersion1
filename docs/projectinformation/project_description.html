<div id="main" class="instruction" style="width: 100%; height:1000px;">The archaeological remains of the royal residential city of Memphis and its related necropoleis are located 18 km south of modern Cairo on today's west bank of the Nile. Until now, altogether 13 burial sites of the New Kingdom (1539–1077 BC; after: Hornung et al. 2006: 492) have been identified. The necropoleis cover an area of about 40 sqm, reaching from Abusir in the North to Dahschur in the South.

Altogether 84 monumental tomb structures, whose physical existence is known or has been recorded in the past, have been identified (Staring 2017: 593). Relevant texts and inscriptions – eventually revealing numerous prosopographic data – are to be found not only on the walls of the tombs, but also on different types of objects that were part of the tomb’s original decoration or equipment (e.g. stela, statues, shabtis, sarcophagi).
However, although a great amount of prosopographic data is available and current excavations add substantial quantities of new material regularly, scientific investigations of individuals recorded on Memphite monuments have not been achieved on large scale. A first list of persons attested for the Memphite region, that is not concentrated on titles or professions of individual persons, has been compiled by Wolfgang Helck (Helck 1961: 913–926). In addition to that, Jaromir Máleks second edition of the Topographical Bibliography (Porter and Moss 1979; Málek 1989: 4–7) and Jacobus van Dijks Preliminary List of New Kingdom Names and Titles (van Dijk 1989: 8–12) provided numerous prosopographic data, while the recent works done by Nico Staring (Staring 2017: 593–611; Staring 2015) and Stéphane Pasquali (Pasquali 2011) add even more substantial material concerning the Memphite society of the New Kingdom. The relevant works done so far, like the prosopographic studies were only limited on specific groups of persons, who were – taken by their social status – members of the higher echelons of the Memphite society (Gessler-Löhr 1997: 31–71, see also: Gessler-Löhr 1995: 133–157; Gessler-Löhr 1989: 27–34) and Christine Raedler (Raedler 2011: 135–154, see also: Maystre 1992). In addition, the relatively small amount of data deriving from these individual studies could not serve as a basis for conclusive statistical analyses or further digital processing.
Thus, it is the aim of the Prosopographia Memphitica Project (ProM) to attain a regional prosopography for the Memphite region of the second millennium BC, which shall shed new light not only on the identity of individuals, but on the reconstruction of personal connections within a historical network of people. </div>
