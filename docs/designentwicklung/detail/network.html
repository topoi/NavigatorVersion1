  <h1>About Network Studies</h1>
  <br>
  Prosopographical datain general can be divided into two types. The first one provides information about individualidentities. Thus, prosopographic data forms the basic requirement for the manifestation ofpersonal and social identities within a social community.
  <br>
  As a second type,prosopographical data is relational data which describe the interconnections and relations ofindividual persons, who can be assigned to a network of persons. Thus, prosopographicaldata is not just a criterion to identify a person, but it is a network parameter which forms thecommon basis for connecting people within the same network. According to Pierre Bourdieu(Bourdieu 1983: 191), those reciprocal personal interrelations generate social capital and as aresult,   the   social   position   and   social   status   of   an   individual   is   strengthened   by   theparticipation to a network of persons. The participation to a group or a network can bedefined   by   social   and   genealogical   affiliations,   gender,   institutional   background   andgeographic origin.

The basic principle ofnetwork studies is, that neither individuals nor social groups form the basic components of asocial community, but the social relations, which are manifested in social networks (Düring –von Keyserlingk 2015: 338). A prosopographical network is a set of individual actors of ahistorical group of persons and their relations. By network analysis those relational patternscan be investigated by using graph theory (Prell 2012: 9). Within a network graph each personis represented by a node and each connection is shown as an edge. An individual might beconnected to any other member of the network in a direct way, for example in case ofgenealogical affiliations. But as it has been already stated by the American psychologistStanley Milgram (Milgram 1967: 60–70), individuals can be linked to each other indirectly bythe common connection to other people as well. The shape of the network is irrelevant andnodes can be placed anywhere, but to create a network, nodes have to be connected byedges.In addition, there are many network measures to describe the features of a network,either as a whole, as well as those of individual nodes and edges (Prell 2012: 96– 114). Butwhat does this statistical measurement reveal about the relational patterns of the network?
<br>
<p style="font-family:italic"> "If two persons arefive removes apart, they are far apart indeed. [...] Thus, when we speak of five intermediaries, weare talking about an enormous psychological distance between the starting and target points,a distance which seems small only because we customarily regard ‘five’ as a small manageablequantity."(Milgram 1967: 67)</p>
<br>
In this way, statisticalmeasurements of personal interrelations within a network have to be valuated with criticism,since it does rather describe the quantitative features of a network and its individual nodesand ties, than the quality of individual relations. According to Milgram’s observation, it has tobe stated that although the distance between two individuals seems to be remarkably small,it is not evident if they were conscious of the fact that they participate to the same networkand   were   connected   by   common   acquaintances.   As   it   has   been   mentioned   above,prosopographical networks do not document the quality of social interrelations between individual   actors   based   on   personal   contacts   and   therefore   network   graphs   cannot   beinterpreted as an accurate reflection of the socio-historical past.
<br>
Although its applicationis neither limited to specific historical cultures, periods nor specific questions of researchinterest, historical network studies applied on data from ancient cultures does not occurregularly before the 2010s (Maczak 2005; Graham 2006a; Graham 2006b: 359– 362; Ruffini –Graham 2007: 325–336). For Egyptology this method has so far been used only occasionallyand remains mostly limited to Greco-Roman times, since for this period it is possible tooperate with large datasets of complex qualities (Tambs 2019; Tambs 2015: 22–30; see also:Broux  2017:  137–146;  Broux  2016:  303–312). Only very recently projects  start to includenetwork studies into their investigation of material dating to pharaonic times, such as ÉmilieMartinets study on provincial administration during the Old Kingdom (Martinet 2013; Martinet2019), Veronika Dulíkovás and Radek Maříks work on Old Kingdom nepotism networks usingdatasets from Abusir (Dulíková – Mařík 2017: 63–83; Dulíková – Mařík 2019; Mařík 2019), theexamination of the Amarna letter corpus by Eric and Diane Cline (Cline – Cline 2015: 17–44) aswell as the investigation of relational patterns of upper Egyptian elites in the New Kingdom,which has been done as a PhD research project by Vincent Chollier (Chollier 2017; Chollier2019).
